My dreams often feel very real to me. Through those disturbing images in my mind, I feel that dreams are an extension of my emotions. Even though the images aren’t real, they can keep my mind in a state of intense emotions.

## RESEARCH PROCESS

The ability of an image to distort the real. An image is an "apparent falsification" of the real; it is considered to be an illusion.

*Jean Baudrillard – Simulations (1983)*

The Lake Tai stones (limestone formations) were a reference for my project. The Lake Tai stones have a variety of formations that appear unearthly and surreal.

Guo Xi, a painter from Song Dynasty, suggested in “Mountains have Three Distances” that perception is a distillation of the mind's intermingling with the realm through the practical observation of the landscape. He suggested that the landscape could remove mundane emotions, even though the landscape itself is just a material object. In order to break this barrier, Guo Xi proposes the concept of “farness” to extend the shape of the landscape. The viewer's eye is inevitably shifted to his imagination, thus underlining the “nothingness” in the distance.

A study published in the American journal “Current Biology” suggested that people who are dreaming not only understand what others are saying, but could also communicate with bystanders and remember what happened after they’re awake. This experiment accounts for people with different cultural backgrounds from around the world.

The project started with thinking about the connection between dreams and simulacra. When a person is dreaming, the brain will perceive simple images in the form of a dream, but the brain can’t use complex functions. The transmitting and receiving nerves are also mostly shut-off and can’t process time or space, much less recognize the realness of the images. The imagery in people’s dreams are similar to simulacra. In a way, trying to forget the deception of dreams is the pursuit of reality.

## CLAY'S UNIQUE NATURE
![Image](/assets/images/slide_4_image.png){: .center-image }


Clay has a very unique nature: it has tension and perception. When people apply force to the clay, it’s like a mutual perception between people and nature, creating a dialogue between physical objects and mental images. I “create” things through understanding of nature and my perception at the moment, giving form to my imagination.

## CREATOR OF DREAMS

![Image](/assets/images/slide_5_image.png){: .center-image }

I’m the creator of my dreams, yet I try to forget the deceptions of my dreams after I wake up. This contradiction reflects my fear of losing the sense of self in a way. The smoke generated from firing ceramics dissipates in a cycle, similar to fleeting moments of dreams that I grasp onto and then force myself to forget about. People are often afraid of being deceived, yet our minds deceive us. We are afraid of losing our sense of self, but we create this feeling of deception in our own subconscious. I tried to capture this state of mind in my work.
